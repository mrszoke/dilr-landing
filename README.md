# Dìlr – Personalized Deals & Local Offers

**Dìlr** is an early-stage platform concept that delivers
personalized deals and offers based on user interests,
lifestyle, and real-time location.

🔗 **Live landing page:** https://dilr.app

## Why Dìlr?

Most deal apps and newsletters:
- send irrelevant offers,
- require a separate app for every store,
- ignore where the user actually is.

Dìlr aims to solve this with a **single, clean feed**
that only shows offers users actually care about.

## Core Concept

- 🎯 Personalized deals based on interests and habits  
- 📍 Local offers from nearby cafés, shops, and restaurants  
- 🔔 Location-based notifications for nearby discounts  
- 📱 One app instead of dozens of separate store apps

## Tech Stack

- **Astro** – static site generation  
- **CSS** – custom responsive styling  
- **Netlify** – hosting and deployment  
- **GitHub** – version control
